Flashcards are used to help memorization.  This flashcard app contains popular coding acronyms and helps build knowledge on common words and phrases in coding. It uses spaced repetition by employing the Leitner method. There are five separate boxes and all cards begin in box 1.

If the acronym is guessed, the user clicks "I know" and the card is moved into the second box. The next card is shown.

If the user does not know the acryonym, they can reveal the answer, but the card remains in the first box.

The system is effective because as the user progresses through the cards, the most known cards will be moved to higher boxes and the not known will be sent back to box 1.  The user's goal is get all the cards to box 5, which would mean that they successfully guessed each acronym at least four times.

The user can add or edit cards to customize their study topics.
